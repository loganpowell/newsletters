Subject:
## CitySDK v2 Tutorials Now on YouTube

Body:
For those developers new to using the Census API we have created a tutorial, which draws a simple and straightforward path to discovering the data you're interested in and then finding their home in the API. 

## Introduction to Census APIs and [data.census.gov]() on [YouTube]()

![Screenshot]()

In this video we'll use [data.census.gov]() to search for variables by topic and available geography. Then we'll use the metadata exposed in the tool to aid our discovery of those variables in the API


## Getting Started with The [CitySDK]()

![Screenshot]()

In this tutorial, we'll continue where we left off from the Introduction video, but we will focus on a library designed to help JavaScript developers incorporate Census data and/or build maps using these data.

## Advanced Use with the [CitySDK]()

In this third and final tutorial, we'll dive deeper into the capabilities of the [CitySDK]() and show some example applications built using it.
