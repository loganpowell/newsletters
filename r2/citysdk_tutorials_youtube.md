## CitySDK v2 Tutorials Now on YouTube

# Body:

For those developers new to using the Census API we have created a tutorial, which draws a simple and straightforward path to discovering the data you're interested in and then finding their home in the API. 

## Introduction to Census APIs and [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) on [YouTube]()

In this video we'll use [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/) to search for variables by topic and available geography. Then we'll use the metadata exposed in the tool to aid our discovery of those variables in the API
